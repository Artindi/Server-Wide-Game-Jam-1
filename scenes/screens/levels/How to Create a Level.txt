If anyone wants to make a level right click on 'template.tscn' in the 'scenes/screens/levels' section and click 
New Inherited Scene, make sure the level is in the same folder as the template, and name it level_x 
(replace x with the level number). Then, change the main node name to Level x, and change the Next Level exported 
variable in the objective node to be whatever level you are doing plus 1 or if you're not making the next level you could
make it the same level. Then, go into level_select and add the level into 'array' and create a button for it 
by duplicating the latest button (highest level). After that, you have to go into the Node section on the top right and 
double click pressed() and connect it to Level Select then you can copy the 
get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://scenes/screens/levels/level_x.tscn") from another _on_button_pressed() function 
and change x to whatever level you made. Then the level should be set up for use. You can add to the level, it will just 
always have the player, tilemap, and objective.
