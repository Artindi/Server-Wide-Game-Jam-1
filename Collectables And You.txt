Collectables are saved under "SaveSystem.save_game.collection"

Each collectable has a seperate flag. Don't forget to change the flag in the metadata to make each collectable unique.

In each level, drag each collectable into the exported array in the win_screen in order for it to count them.
Make sure to give each collectable the metadata levelNumber-itemNumber, so the 2nd collectable in level 6 would 
	be labled 06-02 ("order" doesn't matter, each collectable just has to have unique metadata). The actual value 
	of the metadata doesn't *really* matter but I figure it's good to be consistent
